# Twinkie
Twinkie is a QOL modification for TrackMania Forever, currently featuring 2 modules: Dashboard, and Medals

# Special thanks
To [GreffMASTER](https://github.com/GreffMASTER) and [brokenphilip](https://github.com/brokenphilip) for helping me during development. brokenphilip has his own [tool for TMUF](https://github.com/BulbToys/TMUF) and GreffMASTER [as well (for TM1.0)](https://github.com/GreffMASTER/TMStuff) if you're interested in more cool mods for old TM games.
GreffMASTER also provided me with a helpful list of class members and their offsets for TMF <3

# TODO (from most viable to least)
- Port some openplanet plugins (2 out of ???)
- ~~Add saving settings as .ini file~~
- Add `ManiaPlanet_Telemetry`
- Export as ASI instead of DLL for easier debugging
- ~~Hook `Present` instead of `EndScene`, as TMF uses `EndScene` for lightmap calculations~~
- Full Modloader support
