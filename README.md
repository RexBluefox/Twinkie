# Twinkie
Twinkie is a QOL modification for TrackMania Forever, currently featuring only 1 module (Dashboard)

# TODO (from most viable to least)
- Add saving settings as .ini file
- Port some openplanet plugins
- Export as ASI instead of DLL for easier debugging
- ~~Hook `Present` instead of `EndScene`, as TMF uses `EndScene` for lightmap calculations~~
- Full Modloader support
