# Twinkie
Twinkie is a QOL modification for TrackMania Forever.

## Special thanks
To [GreffMASTER](https://github.com/GreffMASTER) and [brokenphilip](https://github.com/brokenphilip) for helping me during development. brokenphilip has his own [tool for TMUF](https://github.com/BulbToys/TMUF) and GreffMASTER [as well (for TM1.0)](https://github.com/GreffMASTER/TMStuff) if you're interested in more cool mods for old TM games.\
GreffMASTER also provided me with a helpful list of class members and their offsets for TMF, alongside brokenphilip helping me along my RE journey for this project <3

## Features
- Ghost Editor, allows you to access the ghost editor without the cheat code
- Dashboard, an input display and **NEW!** gear display (tachometer, and gear number indicator) with customizable options
- **NEW!** Checkpoint counter, does what it says right on the tin
- Medals window, for easily viewing medals
- **NEW!** Tweaker, for customizing your render distance (even though TMUnlimiter already does that)

## Limitations
- For some people, the F3 keybind to close the UI bar doesn't work
- Medal.tv randomly works and randomly doesn't

## Create separate builds for different TMF variants
The visual studio solution already comes with various build options for some TMF variants.\
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25da4bde-8146-4740-94d6-d7e75660a87a)\
Building in x64 is **not supported** since TMF is 32-bit.\
If you're having compilation issues, make sure you're ONLY compiling to x86/Win32.\
Building for United and Nations is not currently supported. Only Modloader builds are.

## Support me
There currently aren't any monetary ways of supporting me, so if you like Twinkie and you have a github account, please star it so that more people see it, or be kind enough to share it with your friends.
