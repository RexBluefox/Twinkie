# Twinkie
Twinkie is a QOL modification for TrackMania Forever.

## Special thanks
To [GreffMASTER](https://github.com/GreffMASTER) and [brokenphilip](https://github.com/brokenphilip) for helping me during development. brokenphilip has his own [tool for TMUF](https://github.com/BulbToys/TMUF) and GreffMASTER [as well (for TM1.0)](https://github.com/GreffMASTER/TMStuff) if you're interested in more cool mods for old TM games.
GreffMASTER also provided me with a helpful list of class members and their offsets for TMF <3

## Features
- **NEW!** Ghost Editor, allows you to access the ghost editor without the cheat code
- Dashboard, an input display with customizable colors
- Medals window, for easily viewing medals

## TODO (from most viable to least)
- Port some openplanet plugins (2 out of ???)
- ~~Add saving settings as .ini file~~
- ~~Create a launcher for easier usage~~
- Add `ManiaPlanet_Telemetry`
- Prevent clicks from going "through" the UI
- ~~Hook `Present` instead of `EndScene`, as TMF uses `EndScene` for lightmap calculations~~
- Full Modloader support
