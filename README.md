# Twinkie
Twinkie is a QOL modification for TrackMania Forever.

## Special thanks
To [GreffMASTER](https://github.com/GreffMASTER) and [brokenphilip](https://github.com/brokenphilip) for helping me during development. brokenphilip has his own [tool for TMUF](https://github.com/BulbToys/TMUF) and GreffMASTER [as well (for TM1.0)](https://github.com/GreffMASTER/TMStuff) if you're interested in more cool mods for old TM games.
GreffMASTER also provided me with a helpful list of class members and their offsets for TMF <3

## Features
- Ghost Editor, allows you to access the ghost editor without the cheat code
- Dashboard, an input display and **NEW!** gear display with customizable options
- **NEW!** Checkpoint counter, does what it says right on the tin
- Medals window, for easily viewing medals

## Limitations
- Currently, you have to launch the game in windowed mode, then put it back into fullscreen for Twinkie to work properly.
- For some people, the F3 keybind to close the UI bar doesn't work
- Only works with Vanilla Standalone TMF

## Create separate builds for different TMF variants
The visual studio solution already comes with various build options for some TMF variants.
