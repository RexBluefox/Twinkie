# Getting started
In order to get started with making your own modules in your build of Twinkie, you need to first understand some basic C++ class inheritance (including virtual functions). Once you understand that, you can go ahead and make a new .h file in the Modules directory.

# `IModule`
`IModule` is the class that all modules inherit from, and your module is required to adhere to the specifications of `IModule` and inherit from it.
